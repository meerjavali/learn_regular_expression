    <p>hi guys, My name is Meer. I made this project for learning regular expressions.</p>
    <P><strong [style]="'color:red;'">what is Regular Expression?</strong>  Regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) sometimes referred to as rational expression, is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text</P>
    <p>You could also join me in learning. just take the clone of the repo and start learning. I always believe learning by doing, so I made this. dont worry if you are new to this. below steps will guide you..</p> 
    <p>step 1 clone my repo from here <a href="https://github.com/meerjavali/learn_regular_expression"> my repo </a></p>
    <p>step 2 create your branch from main branch</p>
    <p>step 3 go to project folder and do npm install</p>
    <p>step 4 go to users create a component using the command "ng g c 'your-github-profile-name'"</p>
    <p>step 5 write your own input field and add validations or you can copy my code from here at 'user/meerjavali' just add your validation service name </p>
    <p>step 6 write your validation service logic at at 'common/validation.service.ts'. </p>
    <p>step 7 write your custom messages at common enum file at 'common/static-message.ts'</p>
    <p>step 8 raise a pull request to main branch</p>
    <p>After successful merge you can see your results at "regular-Exp.web.app/'your-github-profile-name'"</p>
     <p> example my page
       <a href="regular-Exp.web.app/meerjavali"> my page</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
